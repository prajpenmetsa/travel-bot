*   **Picnics:** Pack lunches and snacks from supermarkets.
*   **Free Attractions:** Vondelpark, Begijnhof, free walking tours, exploring different neighborhoods.
*   **I Amsterdam City Card:** If you plan to visit many museums and attractions, this card might be worth it. Calculate carefully if it saves you money compared to paying individually.
*   **Cook Your Own Meals:** Some hostels have kitchens you can use.
*   **Bike Rental:** While not *free*, renting a bike for a day or two can be a cheaper way to get around than public transport for certain distances.

This budget is a guideline, and actual costs can vary depending on your spending habits and choices. Booking accommodation and popular attractions well in advance is highly recommended, particularly for budget options and during peak season. Have a great trip!
