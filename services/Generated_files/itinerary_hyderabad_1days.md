## BUDGET BREAKDOWN

Okay, here's a budget breakdown for a moderate, one-day trip to Hyderabad, focusing on food, nightlife, and history. I'll provide estimates in both INR (Indian Rupees) and USD (United States Dollars). I'll assume a moderate level of spending, meaning not the cheapest possible, but not luxury either. Exchange rate is roughly 1 USD = 83 INR.  I'll round up to the nearest dollar.

**Assumptions:**

*   Traveler is arriving in the morning and departing late at night, maximizing the day.
*   Traveler is comfortable using a mix of ride-hailing apps (Ola, Uber) and auto-rickshaws for transport.
*   'Nightlife' focuses on a single, moderately priced bar or pub visit.
*   Food choices will include local specialties, and not only western/international options.
*   Activities will focus on a manageable set that can be done in a day.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Currency Exchange:** Get the best exchange rate possible before or upon arrival. Avoid exchanging currency at airports if possible, as rates are usually less favorable.
*   **Bargaining:** Bargaining is common in auto-rickshaws and markets. Be polite but firm.
*   **Transportation Apps:** Download Ola and Uber before your trip and familiarize yourself with how they work in Hyderabad.
*   **Safety:** Be aware of your surroundings, especially at night. Stick to well-lit and populated areas.
*   **Adjustments:** This is just an estimate, and your actual spending will depend on your choices. You can lower the cost by eating at less expensive restaurants or using public transportation more often (Hyderabad has a decent bus system, though it can be crowded).
*   **Entrance Fees:** Check updated entrance fees for attractions online before your visit as these can change.
*   **Cash vs. Card:** While many places accept cards, especially in tourist areas and nicer restaurants, having cash on hand is essential for smaller vendors, auto-rickshaws, and some markets.
*   **Health:** Drink bottled water and be mindful of food hygiene, especially when eating street food.

This detailed breakdown should provide a solid foundation for planning your one-day Hyderabad adventure! Enjoy!
