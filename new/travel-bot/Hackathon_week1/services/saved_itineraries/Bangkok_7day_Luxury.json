Budget accordingly for good service in restaurants, spas, and for tour guides.\n*   **Bargaining:**  In some markets and with tuk-tuk drivers, bargaining is expected.\n*   **Credit Card Fees:** Be aware of potential foreign transaction fees charged by your credit card company. Consider using a travel credit card with no foreign transaction fees.\n*   **Cash vs. Card:**  While credit cards are widely accepted at major hotels and restaurants, it's still essential to have cash for smaller establishments, markets, and street food stalls.\n*   **Booking in Advance:**  Book your hotel and popular tours/activities in advance, especially during peak season, to secure the best prices and availability.\n*   **Currency Fluctuations:**  The USD/THB exchange rate can fluctuate, so factor in potential changes.\n*   **Personal Taste:** This is a general luxury budget. Your own tastes may lead you to spend more or less in specific categories. For example, some people don't drink, which would save on nightlife.\n\nThis should give you a good starting point for planning your luxurious 7-day Bangkok adventure! Enjoy your trip!\n",
