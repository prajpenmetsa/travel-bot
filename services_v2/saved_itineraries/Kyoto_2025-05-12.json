The journey up the hill to Kiyomizu-dera is an experience in itself, surrounded by winding streets filled with tea shops and traditional crafts. We'll explore the temple grounds, stopping at the [Niomon Gate](https://www.google.com/search?q=Niomon+Gate+Kiyomizu-dera), a formidable structure marking the entrance to this sacred space. From the main hall's wooden stage, we'll soak in the stunning views of the city below.\n\nWe'll then explore the adjacent [Higashiyama District](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3959.html), wandering through its charming streets lined with traditional shops and tea houses. We'll stop to sample local sweets and handicrafts, immersing ourselves in the authentic atmosphere of old Kyoto.\n\nLunch will be a delightful affair at [Arashiyama Yoshimura](https://www.yoshimura-gr.jp/en/soba/), located in the scenic Arashiyama district. Savor the fresh flavors of handmade soba noodles, while enjoying breathtaking views of the Togetsukyo Bridge and the Hozugawa River.\n\nBefore heading to the airport, we'll explore [Kintetsu Mall Miyakomichi](https://www.kintetsu-rs.com/miyakomichi/), a treasure trove of local crafts, souvenirs, and delicacies.

Consider hiring a taxi for convenience.\n*   Lunch: [Honke Owariya](https://honke-owariya.co.jp/) - Try the traditional soba noodles.\n*   Afternoon: Explore [Nijo Castle](https://nijo-jocastle.city.kyoto.lg.jp/) (Former Shogun residence).\n*   Evening: Indulge in a Kaiseki dinner at [Kikunoi](https://kikunoi.jp/english/store/akashi/).\n\n**Day 2:**\n\n*   Morning: Visit [Fushimi Inari Shrine](https://inari.jp/en/) (Thousands of red torii gates). Take the JR Nara Line.\n*   Lunch:  Find a local restaurant near Fushimi Inari (budgeted within the overall food cost).\n*   Afternoon: Participate in a traditional tea ceremony.\n*   Late Afternoon: Explore [Kiyomizu-dera Temple](https://www.kiyomizudera.or.jp/en/) and its surrounding streets.\n*   Evening: Enjoy a farewell dinner at a restaurant of your choice, or explore the Gion district.\n\n**Notes:**\n\n*   **Accommodation:** I've selected a 5-star hotel in Kyoto. Alternatives include [Park Hyatt Kyoto](https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/japan/park-hyatt-kyoto/kyoto) and other luxury Ryokans (traditional Japanese Inns). Expect to pay a premium for space, service, and location.\n*   **Food:** Breakfast is assumed to be at the hotel. Lunch and dinner estimates are for high-quality restaurants. Kaiseki dinners, in particular, can be quite expensive.\n*   **Transportation:** The budget includes taxis for certain trips (e.g., to and from the hotel, or to less accessible sites) and the use of the Kyoto subway and bus system.  If you prefer private car service for the entire trip, you would need to add significantly to the transportation budget. A [Japan Rail Pass](https://www.japanrailpass.net/) may be useful if you are traveling extensively within Japan before or after your Kyoto visit.\n*   **Activities:**  This includes entry fees to temples and shrines, a tea ceremony, and the *option* of a private guide for a more in-depth historical tour (highly recommended for a history buff). The price for a qualified English-speaking guide can vary greatly, from 20,000 JPY to 50,000 JPY or more per day.\n*   **Miscellaneous:** This covers small purchases, souvenirs, and any unexpected expenses.\n\nThis budget provides a starting point. You can adjust it based on your specific tastes and preferences. Booking accommodation and popular restaurants well in advance is highly recommended, especially during peak season.
