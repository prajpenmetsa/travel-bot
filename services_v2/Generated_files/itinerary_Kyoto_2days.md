*   Evening: Enjoy a farewell dinner at a restaurant of your choice, or explore the Gion district.

**Notes:**

*   **Accommodation:** I've selected a 5-star hotel in Kyoto. Alternatives include [Park Hyatt Kyoto](https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/japan/park-hyatt-kyoto/kyoto) and other luxury Ryokans (traditional Japanese Inns). Expect to pay a premium for space, service, and location.
*   **Food:** Breakfast is assumed to be at the hotel. Lunch and dinner estimates are for high-quality restaurants. Kaiseki dinners, in particular, can be quite expensive.
*   **Transportation:** The budget includes taxis for certain trips (e.g., to and from the hotel, or to less accessible sites) and the use of the Kyoto subway and bus system.  If you prefer private car service for the entire trip, you would need to add significantly to the transportation budget. A [Japan Rail Pass](https://www.japanrailpass.net/) may be useful if you are traveling extensively within Japan before or after your Kyoto visit.
*   **Activities:**  This includes entry fees to temples and shrines, a tea ceremony, and the *option* of a private guide for a more in-depth historical tour (highly recommended for a history buff). The price for a qualified English-speaking guide can vary greatly, from 20,000 JPY to 50,000 JPY or more per day.
*   **Miscellaneous:** This covers small purchases, souvenirs, and any unexpected expenses.

This budget provides a starting point. You can adjust it based on your specific tastes and preferences. Booking accommodation and popular restaurants well in advance is highly recommended, especially during peak season. Enjoy your trip to Kyoto!
