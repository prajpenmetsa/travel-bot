**Total Estimated Cost: 254,000 NPR / $1,909.76 USD**

**Important Considerations & Notes:**

*   **Accommodation:**  This is the largest variable. Prices can be higher during peak season. Book in advance, especially if targeting specific luxury hotels. I suggest the [Dwarika's Hotel](https://dwarikas.com/) for its cultural experience and focus on preserving Nepali heritage.
*   **Food:** Prices for luxury dining are based on Western standards. You *could* eat much cheaper, but this budget assumes you want top-quality ingredients and service. Alcohol can be surprisingly expensive in some places.
*   **Transportation:** Negotiate the price with your driver beforehand and confirm if it includes fuel.  Avoid regular taxis; a private car offers much better comfort.
*   **Activities:**  This budget is flexible.  A scenic flight over Mount Everest ([Buddha Air](https://www.buddhaair.com/everest-experience)) or helicopter tours can add significantly to the cost (several hundred dollars). Consider a guided tour of [Pashupatinath Temple](https://pashupatinathtemple.org/) or [Swoyambhunath Stupa](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/nepal/kathmandu/attractions/swoyambhunath/a/poi-1047393).
*   **Nightlife:** Kathmandu has some cool bars and live music venues in Thamel and around Durbar Marg.  Entry fees are typically minimal, but drinks at upscale bars can be pricey.
*   **Miscellaneous:**  It's always a good idea to have a buffer for unexpected expenses. ATMs are readily available, but it's wise to carry some cash, especially for smaller establishments.
*   **Bargaining:** While not as prevalent in luxury establishments, bargaining is common in some markets and for transportation.
*   **Tipping:** Tipping is appreciated for good service, typically around 10% in restaurants.

This budget is a high-end estimate. You can adjust it based on your preferences and choices. Enjoy your trip to Kathmandu!
