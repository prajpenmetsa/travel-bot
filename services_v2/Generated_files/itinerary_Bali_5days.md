**Nightlife Recommendations (included within food or activities):**

*   **Rock Bar at Ayana Resort:** [Rock Bar](https://www.ayana.com/bali/ayana-resort-and-spa/dining/rock-bar) – Iconic cliffside bar with stunning sunset views. Expect to pay a premium for drinks and entry may involve a minimum spend, especially for prime seating.
*   **Potato Head Beach Club:** [Potato Head Beach Club](https://seminyak.potatohead.co/) – Trendy beach club with a pool, restaurants, and bars. Entry is usually free but expect to spend on drinks and food. Daybeds and other seating areas may require a minimum spend.
*   **WooBar at W Bali - Seminyak:** [WooBar](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/dpswh-w-bali-seminyak/dining/) - Stylish bar with cocktails and DJ sets located inside the W Hotel.
*   **Ku De Ta:** [Ku De Ta](https://www.kudeta.com/) - One of Bali's original upscale beach clubs, a classic choice.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Negotiate:** While this is a luxury budget, always try to negotiate prices, especially for transportation and activities, without being disrespectful.
*   **Credit Cards:** Most upscale establishments accept credit cards, but it's always a good idea to have some cash on hand for smaller expenses and tips.
*   **Tipping:** Tipping is not mandatory but is appreciated for good service (around 5-10%).
*   **Peak Season:** Prices can increase significantly during peak season (July-August and December-January).
*   **Health:** Ensure you have appropriate travel insurance and are up-to-date on any required vaccinations. Food and water safety is generally good at reputable establishments, but it's wise to be cautious.

This budget provides a high-end estimate. You could certainly reduce costs in certain areas if desired (e.g., choosing slightly less expensive accommodation or dining at less formal restaurants). However, if you truly want a luxury experience with a focus on food and nightlife, this is a reasonable starting point.
