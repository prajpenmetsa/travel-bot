*   **Alternative:** Enjoy a final *borrel* (drinks and snacks) at a canalside cafe to reflect on your Amsterdam adventure. [Café de Prins](https://www.google.com/search?q=Caf%C3%A9+de+Prins+Amsterdam) is a cozy option.

*   **Supermarkets:**  [Albert Heijn](https://www.ah.nl/) is a popular and affordable option for groceries.  Make your own breakfast and/or lunch.
*   **Budget-Friendly Eateries:** Look for local "eetcafés" (small, casual restaurants) and takeaway places. Try Indonesian food, which is very popular in the Netherlands.
*   **Water:**  Tap water is safe to drink, so bring a refillable bottle.
*   **Picnics:** Buy food at the market and have a picnic in [Vondelpark](https://www.iamsterdam.com/en/see-and-do/parks-and-gardens/vondelpark).

**Nature & Activity Recommendations:**

*   **Free Walking Tours:**  Many companies offer free walking tours (tip-based).  Check online.
*   **Vondelpark:** Amsterdam's largest park is perfect for walking, cycling, or relaxing.
*   **Canal Cruise (Consider):** Consider a cheaper canal cruise [Lovers Canal Cruises](https://www.lovers.nl/en).
*   **Zaanse Schans (Day Trip - Might be expensive):**  While not technically Amsterdam, [Zaanse Schans](https://www.holland.com/global/tourism/destinations/north-holland/zaanse-schans.htm) (windmills and traditional houses) is a popular day trip.  Train tickets can be expensive, so check in advance.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Seasonality:** Prices (especially for accommodation) can vary greatly depending on the time of year. Travel during the shoulder seasons (spring or fall) for better deals.
*   **Booking in Advance:**  Book flights and accommodation well in advance, especially if traveling during peak season.
*   **Free Things to Do:** Amsterdam offers many free attractions, including parks, canals, and markets. Take advantage of them.
*   **Student Discounts:**  If you are a student, bring your student ID card to get discounts on attractions.
*   **Bike Rental:** Renting a bike is a great way to explore the city. [MacBike](https://www.macbike.nl/) is a popular rental company.

This is a starting point, and your actual expenses may vary.  Good luck planning your trip!
