**Notes:**

*   **Accommodation:** Prices can vary widely depending on the season and availability. It is recommended to book in advance, especially during peak season. Cheaper hostel options are available if needed, but the above assumes a basic level of comfort.
*   **Food:** Delhi has amazing street food! Be adventurous but choose vendors that look clean and hygienic.
*   **Transportation:** The Delhi Metro is efficient and cheap, but it can get crowded. Auto-rickshaws are great for shorter distances but always negotiate the fare beforehand.
*   **Activities:** Some temples are free to enter, while historical sites require entrance fees. Check the prices online beforehand. Bargaining is common in markets.
*   **Miscellaneous:** It's always good to have some extra cash on hand for emergencies or unexpected purchases.
*   **Nightlife:** This budget doesn't include specific bar/club entry fees or extensive drinking. If you plan to spend a lot on nightlife, adjust the miscellaneous expenses accordingly. Consider visiting places like [Social Offline](https://www.socialoffline.in/) or [Kitty Su](https://www.thelalit.com/the-lalit-new-delhi/nightlife/kitty-su/). Drink prices can range from INR 300-800+ depending on the venue and drink.

**Contingency:**

It's wise to add a 10% contingency to this budget (approximately INR 4,300 or USD 51.6) for unforeseen circumstances.

**Important Reminders:**

*   **Bargain:** Always bargain when shopping in markets or taking auto-rickshaws.
*   **Stay Hydrated:** Drink plenty of water, especially during the hot months.
*   **Be Aware:** Be mindful of your belongings and surroundings, especially in crowded areas.
*   **Respect Local Customs:** Dress modestly when visiting religious sites.

This budget should give you a good starting point for planning your trip to Delhi. Remember to adjust it based on your own preferences and spending habits. Enjoy your travels!
