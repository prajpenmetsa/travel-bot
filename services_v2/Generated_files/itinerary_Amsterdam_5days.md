Check into your budget-friendly accommodation - perhaps a charming hostel in the De Pijp neighborhood like [The Flying Pig Downtown](https://www.flyingpig.nl/downtown) for a social and affordable experience. Then, embark on a **Local Food Tour** ([Google Search: Amsterdam Jordaan Food Tour](https://www.google.com/search?q=Amsterdam+Jordaan+Food+Tour)).

For lunch, grab a freshly baked *broodje* (sandwich) from a local bakery like [Van 't Spit](https://www.vantspit.nl/en/) . In the afternoon, it's time to get your hands dirty with a **Dutch Cooking Class** ([Google Search: Dutch Cooking Class Amsterdam Budget](https://www.google.com/search?q=Dutch+Cooking+Class+Amsterdam+Budget)).

Take a day trip to [Zaanse Schans](https://www.holland.com/global/tourism/destinations/north-holland/zaanse-schans.htm), a charming village famous for its historic windmills and traditional Dutch houses. While entry to the village is free, you'll need to factor in transportation costs – a bus or train ticket is a budget-friendly option.

On your final evening, indulge in one last Amsterdam treat. Enjoy some [authentic Indonesian food](https://www.cntraveler.com/gallery/best-indonesian-restaurants-amsterdam).
